# CFToolbox
This is a fork of CFToolbox derived from 1.1.3 source code released by steamCooker. It contains multiple fixes intending to make the program easier to use with stmsrvemu server emulator.

* Disabled user authentication requirement since stmsrvemu doesn't support Steam3 authentication.

* Added the ability to select depot version to download on Install tab.

Building this requires MFC. The project targets Visual Studio 2013 to maintain Windows XP compatibility but it should theoretically compile with any platform toolset.
